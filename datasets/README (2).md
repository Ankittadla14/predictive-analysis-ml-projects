# Data Folder

Place small sample datasets here (<=5–10 MB) for demonstration purposes.

⚠️ Do not upload full or large datasets to GitHub. 
Instead, host them externally (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) and link them in the top-level README.

This file exists so that the `data/` folder is tracked in Git even if no datasets are committed.
